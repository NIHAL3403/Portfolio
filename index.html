            <p class="animated-desc">
                <h3>Description: </h3>
                Facial recognition and analysis is a powerful vision tool that can read facial expressions in photos and videos. 
                It takes place in two stages. It uses advanced algorithms to find the right face by first identifying facial features such as eyes and nose. 
                It then analyzes the position of these features, especially the eyebrows, mouth and eyes, to interpret the emotions expressed.<br>
                <strong>Recognition:</strong> <br>
                Stage 1: Identifies key facial features such as eyes, nose, mouth, etc.<br>
                Stage 2: Analyzes the position and movement of these features to interpret the emotions expressed.<br>
                <strong>Algorithms and Techniques:</strong>  <br>
                Feature Detection: Uses advanced algorithms to accurately identify facial features.<br>
                Emotion Analysis: Analyzes the position of features like eyebrows, mouth, and eyes to determine the emotional state (e.g., happy, sad, angry).<br>
                Applications: Security and surveillance, human-computer interaction, market research (understanding customer emotions), and healthcare (detecting emotional distress).
